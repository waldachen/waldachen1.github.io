    <p> Hi there! My name is Walda. I am a senior at Arroyo High School in San Lorenzo, CA. I am Treasurer of my school's environmental club and I am passionate about educating others around me about our lovely planet! </p>

      I picked this topic because I have always had a passion for learning more about the enviroment and figuring out ways to do better for our environment. Whether that is starting a school club with just an idea, or making this website, it fulfills my goal of educating more and more people about our environment. Remember, we only have one world, and we have to make the most out of it.
